## Evolving a table using general Genetic Algorithm
This project aims to evolve a table using multipurpose genetic algorithm.</br>
The first generation consist of randomly generated cuboids, then the genetic algorithm is applied: </br>

The end goal is for it to produce a functional, usable table, able to stand under its own weight and hold up basic objects.

The results of the algorithm produced by its latest version for 400+ generations,
</br> below I've included most interesting and usable creations.

TODO:
Fix the function responsible for calculating center of mass in order to generate more stable designs.
